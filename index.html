                            I was in a shop with my friend the kangaroo, but their sign said,
                            “No Kangaroos Allowed,” and I said to my friend,
                            “Well, what can I do? They don't allow kangaroos.”Guido: Good. I don't like vampires.

                                The 6'3" guard averaged more than 22 points per game after the 2010 All-Star break, and wound up finishing second in the Rookie of the Year balloting.

                                Curry sustained a sprained ankle while practicing with the national team, an injury that lingered for the following two seasons.
                                A return to full health allowed him to regain his &nbsp;&nbsp;dazzling form in 2012-13, and Curry responded by setting an NBA record with 272 three-pointers.
                                Named the Western Conference Player of the Month in April, he followed by leading the Warriors to an upset against the Denver Nuggets in the first round of the playoffs.</p>
